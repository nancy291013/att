AT&T Activation Code and License Key: Starting Your Service
-----------------------------------------------------------

When you purchase a new AT&T device or service, one of the first steps is to activate it. This often involves using an **AT&T activation code** or an **AT&T license key**.

What is an AT&T Activation Code?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An **AT&T activation code** is a unique alphanumeric code provided to customers when setting up new services, devices, or plans. This code links your new device or service to your AT&T account and authorizes network access.

- Activation codes may come via email, text message, or printed documentation with your device.
- You typically enter the activation code on AT&T’s activation website or app.
- Once the code is validated, your device or service is activated and ready for use.

What is an AT&T License Key?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While activation codes are mostly for device or service activation, **AT&T license keys** are more relevant for software-based services or apps related to AT&T. Examples include:

- Security software licensed through AT&T.
- Digital services requiring authentication.
- Special enterprise or business software licenses provided by AT&T.

The license key acts as a digital “permission slip” that enables you to access or unlock the software features. If you lose your license key, you will need to contact AT&T customer care for a replacement or re-issuance.
