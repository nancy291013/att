AT&T Login and Sign In
----------------------

AT&T login and sign in processes are essential for accessing your AT&T account, managing your services, and viewing billing information. The login portal requires users to enter their registered username or email address along with their password.

.. note::

   For optimal experience, ensure you are using the latest version of a supported web browser and have a stable internet connection when attempting to log in.

### Common Login Issues

- **Incorrect username or password:** This is the most frequent cause of login failure. Double-check your credentials and ensure the Caps Lock key is off.
- **Account lockout:** Multiple unsuccessful login attempts may temporarily lock your account for security reasons.
- **Browser cache problems:** Old cookies or cache may interfere with the login process.
- **Two-factor authentication errors:** Users enrolled in two-factor authentication might experience delays or errors when inputting the verification code.

### Troubleshooting Sign In Problems

If you find yourself unable to sign in:

1. Use the "Forgot username or password?" link on the login page to reset your credentials.
2. Clear your browser cache and cookies.
3. Try signing in using a different device or browser.
4. Ensure your account is active and not suspended due to billing issues.
5. Contact AT&T customer care if problems persist.

AT&T Service Activation and Activation Code
-------------------------------------------

To use AT&T services such as wireless plans, internet, or TV subscriptions, activating your service is mandatory. Activation often requires an **activation code** provided by AT&T either via email, SMS, or included in the service package.

### What is an Activation Code?

An activation code is a unique alphanumeric code that verifies your identity and authorizes the start of a new service or device activation. This code is essential for linking your account to the service or device.

### Steps to Activate Service Using an Activation Code

1. Locate the activation code provided by AT&T.
2. Visit the AT&T activation website or use the AT&T app.
3. Enter your activation code when prompted.
4. Follow on-screen instructions to complete the activation process.
5. Restart your device if necessary.

### Common Issues with Activation Codes

- **Invalid or expired code:** Activation codes often have a validity period.
- **Code not received:** Sometimes, the code may be delayed or not delivered due to network issues.
- **Mismatch errors:** Entering the wrong code multiple times can cause errors.
- **Device compatibility problems:** Certain devices require specific activation procedures.

If you encounter these issues, verify the activation code, request a new one if necessary, or contact AT&T care for assistance.
